Puzzle Code
===========
By Mike Gagnon, public domain (see UNLICENSE)

A programming game for non-programmers.

Currently in development. Live demo at http://puzzlecode.org

Goals
-----
* Fun
* Extremely easy and intuitive for non-programmers.
  * Programming is fundamentally challenging. I want players
to focus on the fun challenge of programming --- not the
annoyances usually associated with programming.
* Self contained. Every aspect of the game and programming
language should be learnable from playing the game.
No tutorials. Like what it's like to learn to play Angry Birds.
  * However, there should be a rich help system,
including good documentation for every instruction and error
message.
