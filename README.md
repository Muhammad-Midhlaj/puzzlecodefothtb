Puzzle Code
===========
By Mike Gagnon, public domain (see UNLICENSE)

A programming game for non-programmers.

Currently in development. Live demo at http://puzzlecode.org

Goals
-----
* Fun
* Easy and intuitive for non-programmers.
  * Programming is fundamentally challenging. I want students
to focus on the fun challenge of programming --- not the
annoyances usually associated with programming.
* Self contained
  * Every aspect of the game and programming
language should be learnable from playing the game.
* No tutorials
  * Puzzle Cod comes with a help system, designed to
    teach students the game, without the need to exit the game.
