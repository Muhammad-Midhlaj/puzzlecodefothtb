Todo, ideas, and feedback from MVP testing

- Remove these items from the repo and put them on the wiki
- Have resume button be highlighted in blue (for accidental clicks on pause)
- Now that bots can block each other's movements, it could be helpful to
  add a dubstep button, so that each bot is animated one step at a time.
  Also it could be good to have the option to overlay each bot with its bot.id,
  to help users understand what's going on.
- No one realizes that the green blip means the goto is being executed
- Players tended not to know that that they could only edit when the game
  was reset. IDEA: when player clicks CM when game is still active, then show
  a pop over that says you need to reset the level to edit the program.
- Show check marks next to good lines?
- I think it would be much better if i did recompiles on every keystroke
  (but only show error messages once you complete a line, show a check mark
  as soon as a line is good, and show nothing when the line being edited
  doesn't compile)
- Idea: recompile after every character, but only update line comments if
  there is no error. This way as soon as you type the fourth letter in "move"
  you will get the help text (but you won't get errors as you type it)
- Every time the player does something wrong, popup a suggestion box with
  a tutorial / hint on how to do it right
- IDEA: make a puzzle-code freestyle universe, where there's no objective,
  but you just drop in anywhere and do what you want. Maybe you'll stake out
  a territory, and defend it, or maybe you'll mess up with someone else's
  territory. Maybe you'll build puzzles.
- Perhaps present a popup alert the first time you get a compile error
- Allow user to click on lines to insert break points, which display the
  "pause" button next to the line.
