- Need major work on usability / instructions / walkthroughs.
-- Perhaps present a popup alert the first time you get a compile error
- Implement instructions
- Unit tests
- Puzzle system. Each puzzle contains
-- board map (e.g. coins, blocks)
-- constraints (e.g. available instructions, max program size, max cycles
    before timeout)
-- win conditions (e.g. collect N coins, stop on an exit square, )
-- description: describe the puzzle to the user
-- tips (e.g., explain the "move" instruction, how to compile program, etc.)
- Idea: Campaign format
-- Campaign is composed of a series of "worlds.""
-- Each world contains a series of puzzles. Beating certain puzzles
   opens up access to other worlds. E.g. there might be 10 puzzles in the
   "move / turn" world, but you only need to beat the 3rd to get access to the
   next world. The other 7 are optional.
- Use consistent object-creation idoms
- Multi-cycle instructions
